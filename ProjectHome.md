Genesis Plus GX is an open-source Sega 8/16 bit emulator focused on accuracy and portability. Initially ported and developped on Gamecube / Wii consoles only through [libogc / devkitPPC](http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/), it is now available on many other platforms through various frontends.

The source code, originally based on Genesis Plus 1.2a by [Charles MacDonald](http://www.techno-junk.org/), has been heavily modified & enhanced, with respect to initial goals and design, in order to improve the accuracy of emulation, implementing new features and adding support for extra peripherals, cartridge & systems hardware.

The result is that Genesis Plus GX is now more a continuation of the original project than a simple port, providing very accurate emulation and [100% compatibility](http://code.google.com/p/genplus-gx/wiki/CompatibilityList) with Genesis / Mega Drive, Sega/Mega CD, Master System, Game Gear & SG-1000 released software (including all unlicensed or pirate known dumps), also emulating backwards compatibility modes when available.

Multi-platform sourcecode (core) is maintained through [SVN](http://code.google.com/p/genplus-gx/source/browse/trunk) and [GIT](https://github.com/ekeeke/Genesis-Plus-GX) so that other Genesis Plus ports can take advantage of it, as I sincerely hope this emulator can become a reference for _open-source_ and _accurate_ Genesis emulation. If you ported this emulator to other platforms or need help porting it, feel free to contact me.

Latest official Gamecube / Wii standalone port (screenshots below) is available [here](https://bitbucket.org/eke/genesis-plus-gx/downloads) for download and comes with plenty of exciting [features](http://code.google.com/p/genplus-gx/wiki/Features) that have nothing to envy to your most favorite PC emulators and makes this emulator the most faithful experience for any Sega 8/16-bit fans.

Genesis Plus GX core is also being used in various multi-platform and/or multi-console emulation projects such as:
  * [Retroarch](http://www.libretro.com)
  * [Bizhawk](http://tasvideos.org/Bizhawk.html)
  * [OpenEmu](http://openemu.org/).

Please note that commercial applications like MD.emu, EmiGens, DroidGen or AndroGens available on mobile platforms are all rebranded ports that use an outdated version of Genesis Plus GX and that **none** of the profits made by these applications actually benefit to this project or his contributors. They are therefore not supported.
